"""Unprivileged side of per-VM DNAT reconciliation (design ticket #12).

The actual iptables logic (`build_commands`/`reconcile`) lives entirely in
`deploy/orca-proxy-firewall-sync` now, not here — that script is the only
thing that ever runs with root, and is installed as a single,
dependency-free, root-owned file specifically so nothing in its execution
path is writable by the unprivileged account the sudoers NOPASSWD entry
names. This module is what the Management API (never root) actually calls:
shell out to that sudoers-gated helper via `sudo -n` and parse its JSON
stdout.
